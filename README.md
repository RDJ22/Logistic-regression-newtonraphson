# Logistic-regression-newtonraphson

This project implements logistic regression from scratch using the Newton-Raphson algorithm and compares the results with `statsmodels.Logit`. A custom class-based approach is used to derive and apply the gradient and Hessian, followed by visualization of predicted probabilities vs. actual outcomes.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

> This project involves estimating the coefficients of a logit model using a custom implementation of the Newton-Raphson algorithm. It covers the derivation of the log-likelihood, gradient, and Hessian, followed by iterative optimization. The final coefficients are validated using `statsmodels`, and a visual comparison of predicted probabilities and actual labels is provided.

- Implemented logistic regression from scratch using Newton-Raphson  
- Derived and applied:
  - **Log-likelihood**
